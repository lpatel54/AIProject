# AIProject
# How to Run the Program

To run my Python game, follow these basic steps:

- Make sure Python is installed on your computer. Any recent version of Python 3 will work.

- Download or clone the project folder from this repository and keep all files together in the same folder. The folder must contain:
  - `AI_Project.py`
  - `intro.jpg`
  - `dragon.jpg`

- Open the folder on your computer.

- Right-click `AI_Project.py` and open it with IDLE. You can also run it through a terminal, but IDLE is easier for most users.

- In IDLE, go to the top menu and select “Run” and then “Run Module,” or press **F5**.  
  If you prefer the terminal, navigate to the folder and run:

  ```bash
  python AI_Project.py
